                No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man,
                <b>         C9         A5(9)</b>
                To be the sad man, behind blue eyes

                No one knows what it's like to be hated,
                    <b>C9               A5(9)</b>
                To be faded to telling only lies

                But my dreams, they aren't as empty,
                    <b>C          D        E</b>
                As my conscience seems to be
                        Bm          C9
                I have hours, only lonely
                            D                       A5(9)
                My love is vengeance that's never free

                        C9              A5(9)
                Like I do, and I blame you
                Em                   G             D
                No one bites back as hard on their anger
                            C9                       A5(9)
                None of my pain and woe, can show through
